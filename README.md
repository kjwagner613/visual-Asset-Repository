# Digital Assets | Curated & Projectized

This repository serves as an organized archive of visual assets used across my technical and creative projects. Each file is categorized based on usage rights and licensing status to support compliance, clarity, and collaboration.

## Structure

- **`commercial_use/`**  
  Assets fully licensed for commercial applications or created by me directly.  
  *Includes: source info, project notes, confirmed usage rights.*

- **`creative_commons/`**  
  Assets used under Creative Commons licensing.  
  *Includes: attribution details, original source links, license type.*

- **`source_unknown/`**  
  Assets pending verification. These are tagged for review and monitored by tools like PicDefense.  
  *Usage is limited until clearance is confirmed.*

## Purpose

This repository is:

- A living audit trail for visual assets
- Integrated into automated compliance scanning tools (e.g., PicDefense)
- Part of a larger portfolio initiative under the theme:  
  **“Development, Curated & Projectized”**
